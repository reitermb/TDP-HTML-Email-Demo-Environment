# TDP-HTML-Email-Demo-Environment

## Contributing
Templates should each be added as their own distinct HTML files

For ease of review templates should be linked to from index.html which contains a simple table of contents oriented way to preview templates in-browser 

index.html will auto-deploy to GitHub pages whenever it gets a commit (in main branch)

## Preview templates
Templates can be browsed and previewed at https://reitermb.github.io/TDP-HTML-Email-Demo-Environment/
